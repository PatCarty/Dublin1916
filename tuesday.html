 <a href="images/macneillnote.jpg" data-lightbox="MacNeill" data-title="MacNeill's handwritten note, which reads “Volunteers completely deceived. All orders for tomorrow Sunday are entirely cancelled”, is dated Saturday 22 April 1916 and signed by Eoin Mac Neill.

 <p>Machine guns arrived to the Shelbourne by overnight train from Belfast and the Curragh, and were deployed on the upper floors overlooking St Stephen's Green, so Michael Mallin's men came under sustained fire in the ill-advised trenches that they had dug in the Green. It was only the thick vegetation around them that saved the rebels from heavier casualties, and they retreated to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the Green.</p>

 <p>Despite the fact that British troops were now starting to reclaim positions, Pearse chose this time to issue a 'Manifesto to the Citizens of Dublin', which informed those interested that "The country is rising in answer to Dublin's call and the final achievement of Ireland's freedom is now, with God's help, only a matter of days. The valour, self-sacrifice and discipline of Irish men and women are about to win for our country a glorious place among the nations." The truth was that apart from isolated incidents in Meath, Galway, and Wexford, this was not the case, and volunteers who arrive from Kildare to the GPO on Wednesday are warned not to tell others of the real situation outside Dublin. Pearse also gushed that Irish regiments in the British army were now refusing to act against the rebels.</p>
 
 <p>Up at City Hall, on Dame Street, the rebels had been under attack from artillery and machine guns since the early monring. Troops stormed the building, but the site of Helena Moloney and her female comrades confused them, they thought they were prisoners of the rebels. Once the confusion was cleared up, they were led away and imprisoned in the castle. Later in the afternoon, the Daily Express building on Cork Hill, an outpost of the rebels across the street from City Hall was also stormed. Despite actions like these from the government troops, Dublin was rife with rumour of a successful uprising. Journalists had bveen banned from the centres of action by the government, and reports of the previous days actions had been surpressed. The Irish Times was published but it contained just two references to the Rising. One was a warning from the lord lieutenant, Lord Wimborne, that "the sternest measurers" were being taken against "a reckless, though small, body of men". The other mention was a tiny report about an "insurrectionary rising took place in the city of Dublin" the morning before. As actual fact was not available, rumour was rife. The author James Stephens recalled how he met a "wild individual" who said that the Germans had landed in three locations with forces in excess of 15,000, and that the whole of Cork was in the hadns of the Volunteers. He also believed that German warships had defeated the English, and that "the whole country was up". Panic reached the highest echelons of Dublin society, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Wimborne (Ivor Churchill Guest), from his residency in the Phoenix park, declares martial law in Dublin for the first time in a hundred years, convinced the Germans are behind the rebellion and a larger conflict is imminent. He requests a military response from Brith Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, who although distracted with events in Europe, eventually orders thousands of troops to Liverpool to sail for Dublin.</p>
 <p>Sackville Street saw only sporadic shooting but was beseiged by looters. Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada steps out into the street from the GPO to appeal for order but he is ignored. Diamond rings and gold watches were for sale at knock down prices as children paraded around in sable fur coats and tall hats. The Cable Shoe Company saw looters trying on boots and shoes, and then returning for another pair if the first ones did not fit. Lawrence’s Photographic and toy emporium was also cleared out. Eamon Bulfin remembered watching from the roof of the GPO as children made a huge pile out fo the fireworks in the middle of the street and set them alight. Lawrence's was also set on fire, and blazes like this spread from building to building. Fires set by looters caused a lot of the major damage that the city centre suffered.</p>
