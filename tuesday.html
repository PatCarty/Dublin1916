 <p>Machine guns arrived to the Shelbourne by overnight train from Belfast and the Curragh, and were deployed on the upper floors overlooking St Stephen's Green, so Michael Mallin's men came under sustained fire in the ill-advised trenches that they had dug in the Green. It was only the thick vegetation around them that saved the rebels from heavier casualties, and they retreated to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the Green.</p>

 <p>Despite the fact that British troops were now starting to reclaim positions, Pearse chose this time to issue a 'Manifesto to the Citizens of Dublin', which informed those interested that "The country is rising in answer to Dublin's call and the final achievement of Ireland's freedom is now, with God's help, only a matter of days. The valour, self-sacrifice and discipline of Irish men and women are about to win for our country a glorious place among the nations." The truth was that apart from isolated incidents in Meath, Galway, and Wexford, this was not the case, and volunteers who arrive from Kildare to the GPO on Wednesday are warned not to tell others of the real situation outside Dublin. Pearse also gushed that Irish regiments in the British army were now refusing to act against the rebels.</p>

           <p><br />Although he supported the aims of the rebels, Sheehy-Skeffington opposed the violent methods, prefering civil disobedience. At the rising's outbreak, his first action was to try and aid a wounded British soldier. He was then seen climbing the steps of Nelson's Pillar at the north end of Sackville Street, pleaing with Dublin's poor to cease the looting that was taking place. They responded with jeers so he crossed to the GPO and demanded to speak with James Conolly , who was persuaded to send some men out in an attempt to quell the looting, even firing a few warning shots to try and do so. The next afternoon, Tuesday, he began pasting flyers around, calling for the forming of a citizen's police force, and asking people to attend a meeting that evening to discuss it. The meeting was poorly attended and Skeffington headed home towards Rathmines, followed by a jeering crowd. They encountered soldiers of the 11th East Surrey Regiment near the Portobello Bridge and Skeffington was arrested, after the officer in charge found his name on a list of people to be detained, and taken to the Portobello Barracks.</p>

<p>Captain John Colthurst Bowen-Colthurst, an officer of the 3rd battalion of Royal Irish Rifles, took Skeffington back out of the barracks as a hostage for his raiding party, who went down the Lower Rathmines road, with Skeffington's arms tied behind his back, and Bowen-Colthurst shooting his rifle in the air. They came across two teenagers, one of whom, James Coade, ended up being shot by the officer and left to die for the crime of being out late. The raiding party then left Skeffington under guard at Portobello Bridge and continued on to the shop of Alderman James Kelly, at the corner of Camden Street and Harcourt Road. The soldiers destroyed the shop with hand grenades, after they had heard gunshots which they presumed had come from within. They captured two men who had taken refuge in the shop, Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre, how were both fervent anti-nationalists. After a night that saw Bowen-Colthurst praying and reading the Bible, he ordered that the three prisoners be taken out to a yard to be shot. A squad of seven men were ordered to fire immediately at the three men, who until that moment were not aware they were about to die. The firing squad left the yard, but Sheehy-Skeffington's leg was seen to move, so Bowen-Colthurst gathered another group of four soldiers to fire a final volley volley into him.</p>

<p>Bowen-Colthurst stated in a later report that he believed Dublin was being overrun by rebels and he did not know that military reinforcements were arriving. He also thought his three prisoners were major figures of the uprising. It should be rememberd that this was coming from a man who was sent home invalided from the trenches of World War I, possibly due to shell shock and was described as 'eccentric' for the reckless sacrificing of his men, and his cruelty to German Prisoners. Sir Francis Vale, the major in charge of Portobello Barracks, was horrified when he heard of all this and reported it to the high command at Dublin Castle. Their repsonse was an order to quickly bury the bodies in the barracks yard.H is wife was not informed of any of this and only heard the news of her husband's fate on the Friday. On the same day Bowen-Colthurst,a coompanied by a group of soldiers, forced his way into the Sheehy-Skeffington home in the hope of finding any evidence that could retrospectively justify his actions, ordering a volley of shot to be fired into the house before bursting thorugh the front door. Many books and papers were taken away but, upon examination months later, nothing incriminating was found.</p>
 
 <p>An order for Bowen-Colthurst's arrest was finally made following a conversation between Vane and Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, in London. At his court-martial, Bowen-Colthurst pleaded guilty by reason of insanity arising from shell shock, which resulted in his internment at the Broadmoor Hospital criminal lunatic asylum. A Royal Comission of Inquiry was appointed to investigate the three deaths and concluded that the proclamation of martial law does not allow officers special powers such as those that Bowen-Colthurst took upon himself.</p>
 
 <p>Sir Francis Vane ended up with a dishonourable discharge for apparently failing to cover up the incident, while Bowen-Colthurst was released with a military pension in 1921. </p>

 <p>Up at City Hall, on Dame Street, the rebels had been under attack from artillery and machine guns since the early monring. Troops stormed the building, but the site of Helena Moloney and her female comrades confused them, they thought they were prisoners of the rebels. Once the confusion was cleared up, they were led away and imprisoned in the castle. Later in the afternoon, the Daily Express building on Cork Hill, an outpost of the rebels across the street from City Hall was also stormed. Despite actions like these from the government troops, Dublin was rife with rumour of a successful uprising. Journalists had bveen banned from the centres of action by the government, and reports of the previous days actions had been surpressed. The Irish Times was published but it contained just two references to the Rising. One was a warning from the lord lieutenant, Lord Wimborne, that "the sternest measurers" were being taken against "a reckless, though small, body of men". The other mention was a tiny report about an "insurrectionary rising took place in the city of Dublin" the morning before. As actual fact was not available, rumour was rife. The author James Stephens recalled how he met a "wild individual" who said that the Germans had landed in three locations with forces in excess of 15,000, and that the whole of Cork was in the hadns of the Volunteers. He also believed that German warships had defeated the English, and that "the whole country was up". Panic reached the highest echelons of Dublin society, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Wimborne (Ivor Churchill Guest), from his residency in the Phoenix park, declares martial law in Dublin for the first time in a hundred years, convinced the Germans are behind the rebellion and a larger conflict is imminent. He requests a military response from Brith Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, who although distracted with events in Europe, eventually orders thousands of troops to Liverpool to sail for Dublin.</p>
 <p>Sackville Street saw only sporadic shooting but was beseiged by looters. Se&aacute;n Mac Diarmada steps out into the street from the GPO to appeal for order but he is ignored. Diamond rings and gold watches were for sale at knock down prices as children paraded around in sable fur coats and tall hats. The Cable Shoe Company saw looters trying on boots and shoes, and then returning for another pair if the first ones did not fit. Lawrence’s Photographic and toy emporium was also cleared out. Eamon Bulfin remembered watching from the roof of the GPO as children made a huge pile out fo the fireworks in the middle of the street and set them alight. Lawrence's was also set on fire, and blazes like this spread from building to building. Fires set by looters caused a lot of the major damage that the city centre suffered.</p>
