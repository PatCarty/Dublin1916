 <p>At Boland's Mills, DeValera, impatient for an attack that never comes, orders his men, to their surprise, to abandon the garrison. They move to a nearby railway emabnkment only to see the city in flames. DeValera orders his men back to Boland mills to await for what ever comes next realising he has nowhere to go.</p>
 <p>The city centre was in chaos as General Sir John Maxwell sailed up the Liffey as the new commander-in-chief of the British Forces. "I think the signs are that the rebels have had enough. I will know for certain tonight.", he said in a letter to his wife. He promised, in the form of a proclamation, that "the most vigorous measures will be taken by me to stop the loss of life and damage to property". At most, 2000 rebels now face the roughly 20,000 Brith troops in Dublin.</p>
 
 <p>The GPO suffered from direct shell hits from about 3pm onwards, and the upper stories of the building burned along with most of the street on which it stood. Their position could no longer be held and Pearse infomed his men that they would have to abandon the building and make for, in their initial plan at least, William and Woods' factory on Great Britain Street (Parnell St.) The O'Rahilly led the first group to attempt to make it to Moore street through a side entrance, but a machine-gun at the corner of Moore street and Great Britain street put paid to their attempt, and O'Rahilly fell. Michael Collins led the next group, whio managed to get though, as did the next group containing the leaders, with Connolly carried out on his stretcher, making it to houses on both sides of Moore Street.<br />Before the GPO was abandoned, the prisoners who had been held since Monday were released and  Pearse himself was last to leave, once he had checked over the building to ensure that no one was to be left behind.<br />The rebels made their way from house to house on Moore Street by forcing through internal walls, avaoiding the constant barrage of british bullets. The plan was for Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett, Clarke, Mac Diarmada, and the rest to fight their way through the back streets to Ned Daly's garrison at the Four Courts for some proposed last stand.<div class="img2">

 <h3>The North King Street Massacre</h3>
 <p>On the night of the 28th, after a day that finally saw the British forces make progress in the North King Street area against Ned Daly's 1st Battalion, the South Staffordshires, a group of young, inexperienced soldiers who were deeply disturbed by this, their first campaign, extracted a brutal revenge on the local population. Following orders receied from Gebneral Lowe to clear the area, they began breaking into houses in what can only be described as a murderous rage and, over the Friday and Saturday, put sixteen civilian men and boys to death.</p>
 
 <p>Men were dragged from their homes and shot, at 27 North King Street, four men were killed and buried in the back yard. It was only later, when the bodies were dug up that it became clear that the men were robbed of personal possessions and cash before being killed. At 170 North King Street, three bodies, dead from bayonet wounds, were later found. These bodies included that of Christiopher Hickey who's family ran the butcher shop on the street. At only sixteen, he was the youngest vitim of this killing spree. Nine of the murders were committed in a block on North King Street between Ann Street and Beresford Street — ten houses in a row together that covered just a few yards, with number 27 North King Street standing directly opposite. Two further victims were claimed on Saturday morning on nearby Coleraine Street and Constitution Hill. </p>

 <p> Nearly two weeks later, on the 10th of May, a "heavy smell" was noticed to be coming from the cellar of a bar at 177 North King Street. Two bodies were found, Patrick Bealen and James Healy. At the subsequent inquest, Healy's skull was described as being smashed in 'with some heavy instrument', most likely while the victim was still alive. This discovery lead to an official British military inquiry later the same month. The proceedings were headed up by Colonel Ernest Maconchy, commander of the same Sherwood Foresters who had lost so many at Mount Street Bridge, so it may not come as a surprise that no action was taken against Colonel Taylor or the South Staffordshire regiment, who were described as 'a quiet and respectable set of men'. General Maxwell saw such incidents as 'absolutely unavoidable in such a business' and that responsibility lies with those who would resist 'His Majesty's troops in the execution of their duty'. He went on to express the opinion that his troops had acted with 'the greatest restraint'.</p>
