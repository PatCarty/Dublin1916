<img src="images/connolly4.jpg">
          <p>Connolly was born to Irish parents in the slums of Edinburgh in 1868. After leaving school at 11, he enlisted in the British Army at 14, giving a false name and age like his brother before him. After nearly seven years of service, he came disillusioned and deserted. Back in Edinburgh, he became involved with the Scottish Socialist Federation and, in 1895, moved with his young family to Dublin to take up the position of full-time secretary for the Dublin Socialist Club. Economic hardship drove him to America for a while, where he still kept involved with the socialist cause. On his return to Dublin in 1910, he became involved with Jim Larkin and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Following the Lockout of 1913, he co-founded the Irish Citizen Army with the aim of defending workers and stikers from the Dublin Metropolitan Police.</p>

         <p>In the week before the Rising, the council of the IRB presented MacNeill with a letter, allegedly stolen from high-ranking British staff in Dublin Castle, indicating that his arrest, and that of all the other nationalist leaders, was imminent. The letter, called the Castle Document, was, however, a forgery. When MacNeill learned about the IRB's rising plans, and when he was informed that Roger Casement was about to land in County Kerry with a shipment of German arms, he was reluctantly persuaded to go along with them, believing British action was now imminent and mobilisation of the Volunteers would, at this stage, be a defensive act.However, on learning of the arrest of Casement, and the loss of the promised German arms, MacNeill countermanded the order for the Rising. He asked men he trusted to deliver the order to as many commanders as possible. He himself brought a longer version of the note to the Sunday Independent newspaper, where it was inserted as an advertisement.</p>

 <p>Helena Moloney was at Liberty Hall, the headquarters of the Citizen Army, on Easter Sunday morning:<br />

“I saw Eoin MacNeill’s countermanding order in the paper and heard the discussion in Liberty Hall. Connolly was there. They were all heartbroken, and when they were not crying, they were cursing. I kept thinking, ‘Does this mean that we are not going out?’ There were thousands like us. Many of us thought we would go out single-handed, if necessary.”</p>

 <p>MacNeill’s prevarication over whether or not to go ahead with the rebellion, combined with the late notice, meant that the message caused confusion among rebels, especially in areas furthest from Dublin,  severely reducing the number of volunteers who reported for duty on the day. Members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood delayed the Dublin rebellion by 24 hours.</p>
 <p>Thanks to MacNeill's countermand, only a small percentage of approximately 10,000 volunteers took part in the actual rising. The number of Brisith soldiers in Ireland at the time was low thanks to the first world war, so the extra volunteers would have no doubt made a huge difference to the events of the week ahead.</p>
