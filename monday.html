 <p>MacNeill's countermand, coupled with the failure to land the German Arms and the subsequent arrest of Casement, meant that it was with reduced numbers, just 3,000 combined Volunteers and members of the Irish Citizen Army, that operations actually began at around noon on the 24th. The strategy, such as it was, was to occupy a number of defensible locations across the city until the Irish Volunteers could mobilise throughout the country. Pearse, Mac Diarmada, Plunkett and Connolly led Volunteers from Liberty Hall onto Sackville Street (O'Connell Street) and up to the General Post Office (GPO), while Ceannt led the 4th Battalion to the South Dublin Union, a workhouse that catered for the city's destitute, located where St. James' Hospital now stands, and MacDonagh took the 2nd Battalion to Jacob's Biscuit Factory, on Bishop Street, now the National Archives.</p>

 <p>The first casualty of the Rising took place outside the gates of Dublin Castle. A party led by Abbey actor Sean Connolly and feminist Helena Maloney made their way towards the gate only to be met by unarmed police constable James O'Brien. O'Brien put out his hand arm to stop Connolly, who promtptly shot him dead. The military guard at the gate took this as a serious sign of intent, Major Ivor Price fired a few shots at the rebels who promptly retreated back out of the castle gates, which were pulled shut and so the chance to storm the castle, and capture the relatively undefended, six soldiers in total, centre of communications, and the centre of British Rule in Ireland, was lost. Connolly himself was killed soon after, as the rebels managed to hold the nearby City Hall for less than 24 hours.</p>
 

 <p>In the city centre, the Rebels failed to secure both Trinity College and the Bank of Ireland building on College Green. Notice as you want by this building that there are no windows to the front of it, facing Trinity, although there are indentations. This is due to a window tax that was in place in Britain and Ireland in the 1730s when the building was constructed so it would have been little use from a sniper's point of view, or lack thereof.</p>

 <h3>The GPO</h3>
 The rebels stormed the building shortly after midday, they cleared the public areas and began fortifying the ground floor with anything they had to hand including books and ledgers. They then worked their way through the rest of the building. The staff on hand did put up a defense, a guard in the telegraph room was wounded, but they were quickly subdued. At about four mnutes after tweleve, a less confident than usual Pearse emerged from the front of the building to read the Proclamation of the Irish Republic to, at best, ambivilant Dubliners. Reports of the disturbance did bring a company of British Army Lancers down Sackville Street, who were met with volleys of gunfire.</p>

<img src="images/procseg2.png" width="100%">
          <p>Probably the most important document in Irish history, and certainly the most iconic, the Proclamation of 1916 was printed, under no doubt great stress, by compositors Michael J. Malloy and Liam O’Brien and printer Christopher Brady on the morning of Easter Sunday, 23rd of April, 1916 in a basement in Liberty Hall. Malloy had been initially contacted by M.J. Keogh, a friend of James Connolly, about taking a job. He agreed and was then called to a meeting with Connolly, who told him there was an element of risk to the enterprise as the place where the printing would take place, Liberty Hall, was subject to raids. Malloy reiterated his position, he would take the job.</p>
<p>
Connolly sent for the three men on Good Friday, telling them he wanted a bill in the form of a proclamation for Easter Sunday. They should purchase the suitable type and he would see to the expense. The three men returned on Sunday morning, entering through the back room of “The Co-Operative Stores” on Eden Quay, a store run by Countess Markievicz and Helena Molony. Connolly and Thomas MacDonagh handed the proclamation over to the three men who he then promptly had arrested, so that they could claim, if Liberty Hall was raided, that they were working under duress. Connolly informed the men of the twenty-four hour delay due to MacNeill’s countermand so the job was needed for Easter Monday; he read the proclamation, asking them if the copy was clear enough. The document had not been signed yet; this would take place upon the arrival of a sickly Joseph Plunkett.
</p>
<p>
After setting to work at around 11 that morning, they discovered that there wasn’t enough type to complete the document so it had to be printed in two halves. Type shortages also led to further problems – they had to manufacture the ‘C’ at the end of the word ‘REPUBLIC’ from an ‘O’, and the ‘E’ in ‘THE’ had to be manufactured from an ‘F’ and the lower half of an ‘L’ as can be seen in the picture above. The worn out Otley Wharfdale printing press tested Brady’s skills and smudges and faint printing in the spaces could not be avoided. The job was finished by about 1 am on Easter Monday morning. When the British soldiers later captured Liberty Hall, they found the press with the type for the bottom half of the proclamation still set up.

 Two flags were hoisted above the GPO, one was green with a golden harp and the words 'Irish Republic', which was to survive being constantly shot at and the blaze that was to follow, was captured by British troops and returned to Ireland by the British government to Ireland in 1966, the other was the tricolour which is now the national flag of Ireland (the only tricolour believed to be raised outside of Dublin during the rising was in Enniscorthy). This flag, first presented to nationalist Thomas Francis Meagher by a group of French women sympathethis to the Irish cause in 1848, shows a white centre which represnets a lasting truce between the green of the older Gaelic tradition and the orange, representing the supporters of William of Orange (i.e. the Protestant tradition). The making of this flag was the responsibility of Se&aacute;n MacDiarmada, but the drapers he comissioned mixed up the colours so when it arrived at the GPO it had to be unstitched and then restitched in the correct order. MacDiarmada refused the bill.</p>
 
 
 <p>The GPO was seen as
 
 
 easily defensible (as oppossed to the already mentioned Bank of Ireland, mentioned above), with good communication links to other rebel strongholds, a hastily consturcted wire pulley system connected the GPO to the Imperial hotel on the other side of the street, and, more importantly, it disrupted communication between British forces for the first part of the week.</p>
 
 
 <p>By the afternoon, the city centre was under rebel control and the Dublin Metropolitan Police were pulled off the streets after three of their unarmed members were killed, Michael Mallin's ICA brigade had dug in around Stephen's Green, but, mistakenly, not at the Shelbourne Hotel, and Countess Markievicz was parading around the streets in the Citizen Army uniform that she designed, indeed she was asked by a passer by if she was in a rehearsal for something. The rebels must have felt there were in a good position as the faced the first rainy night. </p>
 
 <p> Plans to take the central telephone exchange come to nothing due to false reports of the presence of British soldiers inside, the rebels give up on the plan without inspecting the building. Communication lines to military barricks around the country, and to London, remain open, and Brigadere General William Lowe, commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland, is able to summon troops to the city. If the British had greeted the rising with initial bank holiday disregard, this 'Fairyhouse' attitude had now dispelled, and troops slipped into the Shelbourne Hotel, and to other locations, unopposed, and now hold a key vantage point over the rebels in the Green on the opposite side of the street.</p>
