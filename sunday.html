<p>Following the successful landing of guns at Howth, and with the distinct possibility of German assistance due to the small matter of the First World War, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a small, secret, revolutionary body established by James Stephens in 1858, whose sole object was to ‘establish and maintain a free and independent Republican Government in Ireland’, conveened a military council in May 1915 to plan a revolution. The council, lead by the likes of Patrick Pearse, Joseph Plunkett, Eamonn Ceannt, Tom Clarke and Sean MacDiarmada, decided on a joint insurrection with the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, led by James Connolly who, along with Thomas MacDonagh, joined the council.</p>

          <h2>Eoin MacNeill's Countermand</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="modal__content">
<img src="images/Sackville_Street.jpg" width="100%">
         <p>In the week before the Rising, the council of the IRB presented MacNeill with a letter, allegedly stolen from high-ranking British staff in Dublin Castle, indicating that his arrest, and that of all the other nationalist leaders, was imminent. The letter, called the Castle Document, was, however, a forgery. When MacNeill learned about the IRB's rising plans, and when he was informed that Roger Casement was about to land in County Kerry with a shipment of German arms, he was reluctantly persuaded to go along with them, believing British action was now imminent and mobilisation of the Volunteers would, at this stage, be a defensive act.However, on learning of the arrest of Casement, and the loss of the promised German arms, MacNeill countermanded the order for the Rising. He asked men he trusted to deliver the order to as many commanders as possible. He himself brought a longer version of the note to the Sunday Independent newspaper, where it was inserted as an advertisement.</p>

 <p>Helena Moloney was at Liberty Hall, the headquarters of the Citizen Army, on Easter Sunday morning:<br />

“I saw Eoin MacNeill’s countermanding order in the paper and heard the discussion in Liberty Hall. Connolly was there. They were all heartbroken, and when they were not crying, they were cursing. I kept thinking, ‘Does this mean that we are not going out?’ There were thousands like us. Many of us thought we would go out single-handed, if necessary.”</p>

 <p>MacNeill’s prevarication over whether or not to go ahead with the rebellion, combined with the late notice, meant that the message caused confusion among rebels, especially in areas furthest from Dublin,  severely reducing the number of volunteers who reported for duty on the day. Members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood delayed the Dublin rebellion by 24 hours.</p>
 <p>Thanks to MacNeill's countermand, only a small percentage of approximately 10,000 volunteers took part in the actual rising. The number of Brisith soldiers in Ireland at the time was low thanks to the first world war, so the extra volunteers would have no doubt made a huge difference to the events of the week ahead.</p>

   <p>The Council ironed out the content of the Proclamation and Pearse, in his role of Director of Military Operations, orderd the preparation of three days of 'field maneuvers'. The real purpose of these maneuvers was kept secret from all but a select few, leading figures like the splendidly monikered IRB leader Bulmer Hobson and Irish Volunteers leader Eoin MacNeill had no idea of their revolutionary intent.</p>

All orders for tomorrow Sunday are entirely cancelled”, is dated Saturday 22 April 1916 and signed by Eoin Mac Neill.

 <p>Confusion reigned in the wake of this new order, forcing the council to postpone any action until the following day. The scene in Father Matthew Park in Fariview, the assembly point for Volounteers in North Dublin, was described as 'a state bordering on chaos, Volunteers coming and going'.</p>
 
 <p>The British in Ireland, led by Chief Secretary Augustine Birrell and under secretary Matthew Nathan, while aware of these rumblings, were more concerned with the recruitment of Irish men to the British army to help with the war effort, and Nathan felt that action against any volunteer action would only endear them to a disinterested populace. A report had been received on April 18th informing the command that two German submarines were accompaning a ship carrying arms to Ireland for a planned Easter Sunday rising, but the arrest of Casement led the British to believe the rising would not now go ahead and, accordingly no preparations were put in place. Only 400 troops stood ready for action in Dublin and most officers were to take advantage of weekend leave to attend the Fairyhouse races on Monday. Authorities learned of the theft of five 50lb cases of dynamite from a quarry in Wicklow, which were believed to have been taken to Liberty Hall. A proposed raid was voted down as it was suppossed that the leaders would not be present anyway and they certainly did not want another Bachelor's Walk. </p>
